# Amazon Clone
  A clone of the Amazon app, with full frontend and backend functionality , dynamic rendering, authentication and many more. The core functionality of the application is up and running, with a few tweaks needed to enhance the UI/ UX experience (e.g. making the website mobile friendly). These changes are being addressed and the site will be updated in due time.
  
  A working mockup of the site can be seen here: https://amazon-clone-mmm.netlify.app/
  
# DISCLOSURE
  This app is in no way intended to "steal" from the company, it is merely a showcase of my abilities. Certain aspects of the app may be changed in order to give it a more personal feel, however, the functionality remains the same.
